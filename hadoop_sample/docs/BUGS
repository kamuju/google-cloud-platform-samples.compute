# BUGS #
########

This is a simple demo intended to demonstrate the usage of Hadoop on Compute.
As such, it is not completely bug-free.

- If apt-get install, wget, or gsutil fails for the coordinator, the user will
  simply observe the 'RUNNING' state for more than a few minutes in
  tools/launch_coordinator.py. If it fails for another instance, the error will
  manifest in the status returned by the coordinator.
- A second coordinator.py sometimes gets launched, and then neither responds to
  port 8888.
- This system doesn't monitor for running instances rebooting/breaking;
  in general, the transience of instances is unhandled.
- See docs/SECURITY.
